      CircleSolver and ClockSolver problems

CircleSolver.java class file
   the file must exist and compile
   you can have a constructor if you like but it's not
      needed so this is a "gimme" of one point
   you must read circle parameters from a file
   you must parse and convert the file lines
   you must error check the input
   you must calculate the distance between centers
   you must output the proper relationship between the
      two circles
   you must have a test script file with 20 tests
      one of which tests for invalid file name
   you must have javadoc comments throughout
ClockSolver.java class file
   the file must exist and compile
   you can have a constructor if you like but it's not
      needed so this is a "gimme" of one point
   you must read time string from the command line
   you must parse and convert the time string
   you must error check the input
   you must output proper formatted binary strings
   you must have a test script file with 25 tests
      five of which test invalid input times
   you must have javadoc comments throughout

Evaluation
==========
Very nice work on this!

CircleSolver only has 17 of the 20 tests, but you do have the five
required error checkers.

ClockSolver only has 17 of its 20 tests, too...

Everything else looks great.

Nice job!
