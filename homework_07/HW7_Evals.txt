Evaluation
==========
HA!!  "banana smoothie".....

This is great work, Timothy, smoothies notwithstanding!  You are testing
both in range and bogus values and your outputs are all good.  Your code
is very nice, very clean.

One little thing to consider is the formatting of messages that are output
to the display.  It helps with readability to make them shorter so that
they don't wrap around....

Nice write up, too!

Nice job and keep up the good work!
