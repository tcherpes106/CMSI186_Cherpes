This problem was always something that confused me as a kid... well it still does, but at least I can comprehend it now. It was crazy to me that in this problem, 99.9% probability is reached with only 70 people, and 50% is around 23 people. When first learning about this problem, I completely rejected that notion. "No way it has to be like 100 people before you near 50%." But after listening to Professor Johnson describe the problem and reviewing his whiteboard math, I began to wrap my head around this paradox. I also then watched a few youtube videos on the subject. My favorite came from Vsauce2, in which he detailed the birthday paradox in a very educational way. The problem became easier to understand the more I learned about the science and math behind probability. This was a super fun exercise because it challenged us to not just write code, but to understand the workings of a logic problem.
