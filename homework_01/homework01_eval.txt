Evaluation for homework01
=========================

This assignment is designed to give you experience with the command line.

Per the specifications, you will need to have a file in your repo with the
commands you used to complete the assignment, along with either the completed
re-ordered directory structure and files, or a zipped archive containing that
structure and files.

This assignment is pass/fail.  If you have the two parts completed, you pass!

I took a look at the "what to turn in" section of the requirements, and I see
that I didn't *specifically* ask for the file containing the commands that
you used, so I'm giving everyone that point for free!

If you have any questions about the command line or how to use any of these
commands, feel free to ask me or any of the TA's in the Lab for explanations.


Here is the breakdown:


file with list of commands in repo          1 pt.  [freebie]
zipped file of directories
   or complete directory structure in repo  1 pt.


You have met the requirements:  PASS

I see you have Earth, Wind, and Fire under both funk and soul!  We all have
different ways of categorizing, eh?  :)

GREAT job on the write up!

Nice work!  Now, on to homework02.
